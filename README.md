# HANGMAN
Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. I also made this a little more special by adding only Albanian name cities from Albania, Kosova and North Macedonia and the player can guess to 7 letters wrong.
